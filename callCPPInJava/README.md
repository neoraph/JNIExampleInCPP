# JNIExampleInCPP
Rewrite the example of this blog (https://chandruscm.wordpress.com/2015/08/10/how-to-use-jni-java-native-interface-with-cc/) which gets this github repository (https://github.com/chandruscm/JNIexamples) in C++

<br>
It is nice example, however, it is written in C and some of functions does not work well in C++.

Thank you Chandruscm, I rewrite it in order to train JNI and use C++11.
