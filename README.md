# JNIExampleInCPP

Just trying and training JNI :

There are two folders :

- callCPPInJava
A few simple examples on JNI to pass objects from C++ to Java 
(reference to : A few simple examples on JNI to pass objects from C to Java https://github.com/chandruscm/JNIexamples)

- callJavaInCPP
Same program as in callCPPInJava except that this time, I instanciate the JVM in C++ in order to use Java object in C++.
